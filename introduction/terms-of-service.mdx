Any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or in connection with these Terms, or the breach, termination, interpretation, performance, or invalidity thereof, brought by you against us shall be finally settled by arbitration in accordance with the Rules of Arbitration of the Panama Conciliation and Arbitration Center (Centro de Conciliación y Arbitraje de Panamá), by one arbitrator appointed in accordance with said Rules.

**14. MISCELLANEOUS**

These Terms and any policies or operating rules posted by us on the Site or in respect to the Service constitute the entire agreement and understanding between you and us.

We may assign any or all of our rights and obligations to others at any time. We shall not be responsible or liable for any loss, damage, delay, or failure to act caused by any cause beyond our reasonable control. If any provision or part of a provision of these Terms is determined to be unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that provision or part of the provision is deemed severable from these Terms and does not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. There is no joint venture, partnership, employment or agency relationship created between you and us as a result of these Terms or use of the Service. You agree that these Terms will not be construed against us by virtue of having drafted them. You hereby waive any and all defenses you may have based on the electronic form of these Terms and lack of signing by the parties hereto to execute these Terms.
