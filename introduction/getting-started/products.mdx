## Products

### Spot trading (NEAR only)

This is the most basic type of trading, where users can buy and sell cryptocurrencies. Spot trading on Orderly is designed to be fast, secure, and user-friendly, with features like real-time market data, a unified order book, and trading charts.

### Perpetual futures trading (NEAR and EVM)

Perpetual Futures Trading is a form of derivatives trading that allows users to trade on the future price of an asset without actually owning it. Orderly offers perpetual futures contracts for cryptocurrencies, which are settled in USDC. This product enables users to trade with leverage, meaning they can open larger positions than they would be able to with their available capital.
