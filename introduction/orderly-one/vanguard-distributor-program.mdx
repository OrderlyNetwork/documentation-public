title: "Vanguard Distributor Program"
---

## TL;DR

The Vanguard Program is the core growth engine for the Orderly One ecosystem. It incentivizes **Distributors** to onboard new Builders (DEXs) through a tiered revenue-sharing model.

*   **Participant Role:** Anyone (EOA) or Builder Owners can participate as a Distributor.
*   **Profit Mechanism:** Revenue is generated via the "Fee Spread" between the Distributor’s tier and their Invitee’s tier.
*   **Scale Advantage:** Distributors level up using the aggregate volume of their entire invitee network plus their own volume.

## 1. Participant Profile

| Feature | Distributor (EOA / Builder Owner) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Role** | General users, Affiliates, or DEX Owners |
| **Revenue Stream** | Referral share (Spread between tiers) |
| **Revenue Settlement** | Trading account (EOA) or Builder admin account |

## 2. Onboarding & Binding Rules

### The 3-Step Setup

Access the portal at [dex.orderly.network/distributor/](https://dex.orderly.network/distributor/) to begin:

1.  **Connect:** Link an EOA wallet via Ethereum, Arbitrum One, or Base.
2.  **Activate:** Complete key creation to initialize the Distributor profile.
3.  **Share:** Use unique distributor codes or URLs to bind invitees.

### Binding Rules (Guardrails)

*   **Unidirectional:** An invitee can only be bound to a single distributor.
*   **Non-Reciprocal:** Cross-referral (e.g., A invites B, B invites A) is strictly prohibited.
*   **Timing:** Binding must be established **at or before** the invitee’s DEX graduation.
*   **Immutability:** Once established, the binding relationship cannot be modified.
*   **Account Type Lock:** An EOA account registered as a Distributor cannot be converted into a Builder Admin account later.

## 3. Orderly Tiering Programme

A distributor’s tier is determined by their **30-day Aggregate Volume** and **$ORDER Staking**.

### Tiers & Privileges

| Tier | 30d Aggregate Volume | $ORDER Staked | Base Taker Fee | Tier Assignment Privilege |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Public** | ≥ $0 | ≥ 0 | 3.00 bps | - |
| **Silver** | ≥ $30M | ≥ 100K | 2.75 bps | - |
| **Gold** | ≥ $90M | ≥ 250K | 2.50 bps | Can assign Silver / Public |
| **Platinum** | ≥ $1B | ≥ 2M | 2.00 bps | Can assign Gold & below |
| **Diamond** | ≥ $10B | ≥ 7M | 1.00 bps | Can assign Platinum & below |

### The Volume Formula

$$
\text{30d Aggregate Volume} = \text{Distributor Personal Volume} + \sum (\text{All Graduated Invitees' Volume})
$$

## 4. Revenue Share Mechanics

### The Core Equation

Distributors earn the "spread" between the invitee’s base fee and their own.

**Distributor Margin:**

$$
Margin = \max(0.1 \text{ bps}, \text{Invitee Base Fee} - \text{Distributor Base Fee})
$$

*(A guaranteed 0.1 bps minimum margin applies to Taker orders even if tiers are identical).*

## 5. Settlement & Distribution

*   **Frequency:** Daily settlement at **00:00 UTC**.
*   **Automatic Distribution:**
    *   **Builder Owners:** Revenue is credited to the **Builder Admin Account**
    *   **General EOA:** Revenue is credited to the **Distributor**
