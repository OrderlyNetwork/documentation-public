title: "Vanguard Distributor Program"
---

## TL;DR

The Vanguard Program is the core growth engine for the Orderly One ecosystem. It incentivizes "Distributors" to onboard new Builders (DEXs) through a tiered revenue-sharing model.

*   **Key Roles:** Participants join as either **Ambassadors** or **Builders**.
*   **Profit Mechanism:** Revenue is generated via the "Fee Spread" between the Distributor’s tier and their Invitee’s tier.
*   **Scale Advantage:** Distributors can level up their tier using the aggregate volume of their entire invitee network.

## 1. Participant Profiles

| Feature | Ambassador | Builder |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Role** | **General users / Affiliates** | **Graduated DEXs** |
| **Revenue Stream** | Referral share only | DEX operational profit + Referral share |
| **Revenue Settlement** | Ambassador trading account | Builder admin account |

## 2. Onboarding & Binding Logic

### The 4-Step Setup

1.  **Connect:** Link an EOA wallet via Ethereum, Arbitrum One, or Base.
2.  **Profile:** Select the "Ambassador" or "Builder" path.
3.  **Activate:** Complete key creation (Builders must complete the "Graduation" process).
4.  **Share:** Use unique distributor codes or URLs to bind invitees.

### Binding Rules (Guardrails)

*   **Unidirectional:** An invitee can only be bound to a single distributor.
*   **Non-Reciprocal:** Cross-referral (e.g., A invites B, B invites A) is strictly prohibited.
*   **Timing:** Binding must be established **at or before** the invitee’s DEX graduation.
*   **Immutability:** Once established, the binding relationship cannot be modified.

## 3. Orderly Tiering Programme

A distributor’s tier is determined by their **30-day Aggregate Volume** and **$ORDER Staking**. This system aligns distributor growth with overall ecosystem performance.

### Tiers & Privileges

| Tier | 30d Aggregate Volume | $ORDER Staked | Base Taker Fee | Tier Assignment Privilege |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Public** | ≥ $0 | ≥ 0 | 3.00 bps | - |
| **Silver** | ≥ $30M | ≥ 100K | 2.75 bps | - |
| **Gold** | ≥ $90M | ≥ 250K | 2.50 bps | Can assign Silver / Public |
| **Platinum** | ≥ $1B | ≥ 2M | 2.00 bps | Can assign Gold & below |
| **Diamond** | ≥ $10B | ≥ 7M | 1.00 bps | Can assign Platinum & below |

### The Volume Formula

>$$
>\text{30d Aggregate Volume} = (\text{Distributor Volume}) + \sum (\text{All Graduated Invitees' Volume})
>$$
>
>*(Note: For Ambassadors, personal volume is treated as 0).*

## 4. Revenue Share Mechanics

### The Core Equation

Distributors earn the "spread" between the invitee’s base fee and their own.

**Distributor Margin:**

$$
Margin = \max(0.1 \text{ bps}, \text{Invitee Base Fee} - \text{Distributor Base Fee})
$$

*(A guaranteed 0.1 bps minimum margin applies to Taker orders even if tiers are identical).*

**Invitee (DEX) Margin:**

$$
Margin = \text{End User Fee} - \text{Invitee Base Fee} - \text{Referral Commissions}
$$

### Fee Spread Example

If the **Distributor** is Diamond (1.0 bps) and the **Invitee** is Gold (2.5 bps) with an **End User** Fee of 5.0 bps:

*   **Distributor Share:** $2.5 - 1.0 = **1.5 bps**
*   **Invitee Share:** $5.0 - 2.5 = **2.5 bps**
*   **Orderly Protocol Fee:** **1.0 bps**

## 5. Settlement & Distribution

*   **Frequency:** Daily settlement at **00:00 UTC**.
*   **Automatic Distribution:** 
    * **Builders**: Revenue is credited to the **Builder Admin Account**.
    * **Ambassadors**: Revenue is credited to the **Ambassador Trading Account**(The trading account created under the ambassador broker).
