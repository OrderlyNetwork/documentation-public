Orderly One is built to empower developers to launch independent DEXes with speed and creativity. Every DEX built on our infrastructure reflects not only your project but also the wider ecosystem.

These Builder Guidelines sit alongside the Orderly One Terms of Use and are meant as a practical code of conduct for builders, outlining how projects should present themselves and how Orderly may respond if the standards are not met.

These Builder Guidelines may be updated from time to time, and the latest version shall apply once updated.

## **Why These Guidelines Exist**

The Builder Guidelines exist to:

1. Protect the reputation and integrity of the Orderly brand.

2. Safeguard the ecosystem from harmful, misleading, or unlawful behaviour.

3. Give builders clarity about expectations from Day 1\.

Orderly One celebrates creativity and independence, but with independence comes responsibility. Projects that are offensive, defamatory, misleading, unlawful, or reputationally damaging may not be promoted through Orderly channels and, in serious cases, may lose access to Orderly One services altogether.

By following these Guidelines, you help ensure the ecosystem remains trusted, respected, and welcoming to both users and builders.

## **What Orderly One Is (and Isn’t)**

Orderly One is a no-code SDK that lets developers launch decentralized exchanges (DEXes) quickly and efficiently. By integrating the SDK, you gain access to Orderly’s backend liquidity, order-matching engine, and cross-chain connectivity.

Orderly One is a toolkit, not a managed service. You control your front-end, branding, and user experience. DEXes created with Orderly One are independently developed and operated by builders, not by Orderly Network.

## **Independent by Design**

1. Do not present your DEX as an “official Orderly product.”

2. You may say your project is “built with Orderly One” or “powered by Orderly liquidity.”

3. Make it clear that users interact with your DEX at their own risk, and that Orderly is not responsible for your operations, marketing, or outcomes.

## **Names and Brands That Build Trust**

1. Avoid offensive, defamatory, discriminatory, or otherwise inappropriate names or imagery.

2. Avoid names that are misleading, confusing, or deliberately controversial.

3. Do not copy or impersonate Orderly, other projects, companies, or individuals.  It is important to respect the intellectual property rights of others.

4. Choose branding that reflects originality, professionalism, and respect for the community.

## **Talk Straight, Build Credibility**

1. Be transparent about your product, fees, risks, and governance.

2. Do not make exaggerated or misleading claims such as “guaranteed returns” or “risk-free profits.”

3. Keep your messaging consistent across your website, documentation, and community channels.

## **Build for the Long Game**

1. Treat your users with fairness and respect.

2. Avoid pump-and-dump schemes, scams, or misleading gimmicks.

3. Do not adopt imagery, memes, or tactics that could be defamatory, abusive, or damaging to the ecosystem’s reputation.

## **Be Compliant**

1. You are fully and solely responsible for ensuring your DEX complies with all applicable laws and regulations.    
     
2. Do carefully consider the users you allow on your platform.  Accepting users from certain countries may attract licensing requirements, while accepting users from sanctioned countries may result in your DEX enabling sanctioned activity.    
     
3. While it is tempting to name your DEX after a famous person, brand or event, this may breach intellectual property laws.    
     
4. While we have mentioned a few examples of legal considerations you should factor in for your DEX, this is by no means exhaustive, and these issues vary from DEX to DEX.  You should seek legal advice if you are unsure of the legal considerations for your DEX.  Orderly is not responsible for your DEX nor any such legal risks.

## **How We Shine a Spotlight**

1. Orderly may choose to showcase projects on its channels, but this is always at our discretion.

2. Projects that show professionalism, transparency, and alignment with ecosystem values are more likely to be featured.

3. Projects that create reputational, legal, or regulatory risk will not be promoted.

## **When We May Step In**

1. Access to Orderly One SDK, liquidity, and connectivity is provided at Orderly’s discretion.

2. Access may be suspended or withdrawn if a project engages in offensive, defamatory, misleading, or high-risk behaviour.

3. Access may also be suspended if a project creates reputational, legal, or regulatory risk.

4. These decisions are made to protect the integrity of the ecosystem and community.

## **Examples: Do’s and Don’ts**

✓ Launch a DEX with a fun, clear, and professional name.  
 ✓ Communicate transparently about fees, risks, and governance.  
 ✓ Use branding that is original and consistent.  
 ✓ Build a community presence that is constructive and engaged.

✗ Launch with an offensive, misleading, or copied name.  
 ✗ Over-promise returns or imply official Orderly endorsement.  
 ✗ Use branding that imitates others or confuses users.  
 ✗ Engage in pump-and-dump style marketing that damages trust.

## **Moving Forward Together**

Orderly One gives builders the tools to innovate, experiment, and scale. These Guidelines exist to protect both Orderly and the ecosystem by ensuring that projects built on our infrastructure maintain integrity while leaving room for creativity.

By building responsibly, and with personality, you strengthen your project and contribute to a community based on trust, transparency, and innovation.
