## Introduction

There will be many ways to trade on Orderly. The users have the option of trading through an API or one of the integrated front-ends built on top of Orderly.

The liquidity of Orderly is shared across all applications that are listed on the platform. Due to the liquidity being pooled in one place, this means that no matter which application you are trading on, users will be accessing the same pool and orderbook. 

While there is not an official Orderly DEX, there are many teams hosting graphical user interfaces (GUIs) on the Orderly infrastructure.
