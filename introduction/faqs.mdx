  <Accordion title="What is Orderly?">
Orderly is a combination of an orderbook-based trading infrastructure and a robust liquidity layer offering spot and perpetual futures orderbooks. Unlike traditional platforms, Orderly doesn’t have a front end; instead, it operates at the core of the ecosystem, providing essential services to projects built on top of it.

Our DEX white-label solution is carefully crafted to save builders time and capital while granting access to our bootstrapped liquidity. Picture having the best features of CEXs while keeping settlements on-chain and maintaining full self-custody.

With Orderly, anyone can create a trading application thanks to our seamless plug-and-play experience leveraging our liquidity and composability.

Looking ahead, our grand vision is to create an omnichain protocol, connecting traders from both EVM and non-EVM chains within the same orderbook.

  <Accordion title="How are trading fees calculated/charged?">

    Fees are deducted from the converted token for spot(e.g. converting USDC to ETH will incur fees in ETH) and added to the cost position for perps (denominated in USDC).

    Each broker sets their own fee rates.

  </Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I list my token on Orderly?">
  Yes! We are always looking to list more tokens on the platforms. Please [reach
  out](mailto:product@orderly.network) to us if you want your token listed.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What are the different order types?">
  **MARKET:** It matches until the full size is executed. If the size is too large (larger than the
  whole book) or the matching price exceeds the price limit (refer to `price_range`), then the
  remaining quantity will be canceled. **IOC (Immediate or Cancel):** It matches as much as possible
  at the order\_price. If not fully executed, then the remaining quantity will be canceled. **FOK
  (Fill or Kill):** If the order can be fully executed at the order\_price, then the order gets
  fully executed otherwise would be canceled without any execution. **POST ONLY:** If the order
  executes with any maker trades at the time of placement, then it will be canceled without any
  execution. **REDUCE ONLY:** Executes buy or sell orders which only reduce a current position
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do you ensure no fake orders are settled on-chain?">
    All orders coming into the Orderly off-chain matching engine are signed by users' private trading keys and are settled on-chain with those signatures. Public keys are stored on the contract and the signatures are verified thus validifying orders.

    The above model ensures that even in the event operator gets compromised, no fake orders are executed and all user funds are safe.
