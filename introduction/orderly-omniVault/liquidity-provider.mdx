LPs can make deposits or submit a withdrawal request anytime via the [Orderly OmniVault App](https://app.orderly.network/vaults). Transactions will be processed in the subsequent vault period. Please note it may take a few minutes for your transaction to reflect across the app’s data, as every transaction undergoes a cross-chain messaging via the LayerZero protocol to Orderly chain.<a href="#ref21"><sup>1 </sup></a>

If your on-chain transaction (deposit or withdrawal request) has a success status, it is assured that Orderly OmniVault has received your transaction request.

## Deposits

LPs have the flexibility to deposit USDC from any supported network. On the deposit section on the app, after inputting the amount of USDC, you will see an estimated number of shares you will receive based on the current share price. However, the actual number of shares issued may vary from the estimate, as the share price at the time of your deposit request may differ from the final vault period settlement share price.

Every deposit transaction is subject to:

- Minimum Deposit Amount: 10 USDC
- Deposit Lock-up Duration: 2 days
  - The lock-up duration begins <u>at the start of the vault period</u> during which your deposit is processed, not at the exact time you made the deposit.
  - Once the lock-up period ends, the shares will be available for withdrawal.

## Withdrawal

LPs can submit withdrawal requests from any supported network. The amount of USDC claimable on each network is determined by the blockchain network on which the withdrawal requests are submitted to. In the withdrawal section of the app, after inputting the number of shares to withdraw, you will see an estimated USDC amount based on the current share price. However, the actual claimable amount may differ from this estimate, as the final settlement share price may vary from the current estimate.

Every withdrawal request transaction is subject to:

- Minimum Withdrawal Amount: 10 USDC

## Claim Your Withdrawal

Once the withdrawal requests have been assigned to a vault period, Orderly OmniVault will begin the redemption process. LPs can typically claim their redeemed USDC approximately 15 to 30 minutes <u>after the end of that vault period</u>. Delays may occasionally occur due to factors such as network conditions or unforeseen delays, particularly during peak periods.

When your withdrawal request status is marked as “Claimable” in the app, you may proceed to claim your USDC on the respective blockchain network.
