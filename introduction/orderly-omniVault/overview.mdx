Orderly OmniVault is Orderly’s flagship strategy vault. It is an omnichain and permissionless strategy vault carefully designed to leverage the participation of protocol stakeholders to amplify liquidity and enhance on-chain trading experience across tradable markets within the Orderly ecosystem, creating new yield-earning opportunities for our stakeholders.

As part of the initiative, Orderly is collaborating with industry-leading market makers (our trusted partners) as **Strategy Providers (SP)**, starting with Kronos Research.<a href="#ref1"><sup>1 </sup></a> &nbsp;We leverage their extensive expertise to execute efficient market-making strategies through the utilization & management of the OmniVault assets. Users can conveniently deposit USDC into the Orderly OmniVault from any of the supported blockchain networks and become protocol liquidity providers, granting them a proportional share of OmniVault’s PnL. This enables them to earn attractive passive yields generated by professional market-marking strategies.<a href="#ref2"><sup>2</sup></a> &nbsp;Orderly OmniVault opens up profit opportunities previously inaccessible to retail users.

## Security
Orderly has completed two independent audits on our strategy vault smart contracts to ensure the highest security level of asset security for users. Audit reports are publicly available on our [GitHub](https://github.com/OrderlyNetwork/Audits).

Users should carefully assess their risk tolerance and the vault’s risk profile before depositing. It’s important to note that every strategy vault carries its own risks.
