  <Accordion title="Are there fees charged for using Orderly OmniVault?">
No fees are charged during the initial launch period of the Orderly OmniVault.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I lose money as an LP with Orderly OmniVault?">
Yes, there is a possibility of loss. Interacting with any DeFi application involves risks. As an LP, you hold shares in the vault and will proportionally share in both the PnL gains and losses, together with other users. Orderly does not guarantee any minimum returns or protection from losses.

  </Accordion>

<Accordion title='Why is my deposit/withdrawal request stuck in the "pending/requested" status?'>
A "pending" or "requested" status means Orderly OmniVault has received your request and is awaiting processing in the next vault period. Please refer to the “Vault Period” section on the OmniVault Mechanics page for a detailed explanation.

</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I expect the actual returns to match the APY displayed on the Orderly OmniVault app?">

The APY displayed serves as an estimate of annualized returns based on past OmniVault performance and is not a guarantee or indicator of future outcomes.

  </Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I transfer or trade my shares?">
No. Share is not tokenised, meaning they are neither tradable nor transferrable. Shares simply represent your percentage ownership of Orderly OmniVault assets.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Has the Strategy Provider deposited USDC into Orderly OmniVault?">
Yes, they have. The Strategy Provider is required to deposit USDC into the OmniVault, which remains locked up throughout their engagement. This ensures they have “skin in the game” and maintains alignment of interests with LPs.
