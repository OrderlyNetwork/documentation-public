title: "Market Making Rewards Mechanism"
---

Adjacent to Orderly Network’s trading rewards, the market making rewards program is designed to incentivize market makers that play an integral role in the liquidity of the DeFi protocol. 10% of the total \$ORDER token supply (100,000,000 \$ORDER) is allocated to market makers who support the liquidity of the Orderly Network’s trading infrastructure. 

## Epoch distribution
Market making rewards will be distributed linearly on an epoch basis over 200 epochs incorporating a Provide Liquidity-to-Earn model capped within each epoch performance.

500,000 \$ORDER is allocated for each epoch for all qualified Orderly market makers. From epoch 7 onwards, the market maker rewards will be distributed as [escrowed \$ORDER](/introduction/tokenomics/esorder) instead of liquid \$ORDER tokens in epochs 1\-6. Any further adjustment of the distribution mechanism will be formally assessed and communicated to market makers in advance. 

## Allocation Mechanism
For every epoch, market making rewards are allocated among Orderly’s listed markets. Each market’s allocation will be based on the following formulas:

$$ PoolWeight_{market}=PoolMultiplier_{market}*\dfrac{activeDaysInEpoch}{totalEpochDays} $$

$$ RewardPool_{market}=\dfrac{PoolWeight_{market}}{TotalWeight} $$

- The pool weight takes account of new listing/delisting of markets with the number of active days in an epoch, prorating the pool multiplier effect.

- Each market’s pool multiplier will be maintained and periodically updated [here](/introduction/tokenomics/market-making-rewards/market-making-rewards#key-information) by Orderly based on market conditions and other factors.

- The amount of market making rewards allocated to each market is determined proportionally based on the ratio across the total weight against all markets.

## Distribution Formula

For each market, $$ Q_{final} $$ is calculated at the end of every epoch for eligible market makers and is determined by four main factors:

1. Quality of Liquidity (Bid Depth and Spread from each market maker’s mid-market price),

2. Liquidity Uptime

3. Staked Balance ($ORDER/esORDER)

4. Maker Volume

Market making performance is monitored and calculated on a minute-by-minute basis (using randomized sampling) and aggregated into a $$ Q_{min} $$ for each market. Orders below a certain **minimum depth size** and/or over a certain **maximum spread** from each market maker’s mid-market price will be excluded from the computation of $$ Q_{final} $$. Refer [here](/introduction/tokenomics/market-making-rewards/market-making-rewards#key-information) for the updated values.

$$ Q_{final}=\sum_{N=1}^{totalEpochMinutes} \{Q_{min(N)}=[\dfrac{BidDepth_1}{Spread_1}+\dfrac{BidDepth_2}{Spread_2}...., \dfrac{AskDepth_1}{Spread_1}+\dfrac{AskDepth_2}{Spread_2}...]\}^{0.35} *[\dfrac{\sum_{N=1}^{totalEpochMinutes}Count(Q_{min(N)}>0)}{totalEpochMinutes}]^5 * [max(10,stakedORDER)]^{0.15} * [MakerVolume]^{0.45}$$




$$ r_{market} = RewardPool_{Market} * \dfrac{Q_{final}}{Q_{total}} $$

The amount of market making rewards a market maker earns from a market $$ r_{market} $$, is proportional to their $$ Q_{final} $$ against the $$ Q_{total} $$ in that epoch.


$$r_{wallet} = \sum^{markets} (r_{market})$$

The total rewards a market maker earns in an epoch is the sum of all the rewards per market. The rewards are consolidated across the multi-wallet linking and are only viewable/claimable by the designated rewards wallet.
