Orderly attributes its achievements to the early adoption of the product by community members over the past two years. A total of 13.3\% (133,000,000 \$ORDER) of the overall supply is allocated to users as a token of appreciation for their early support. Various user categories will have the opportunity to claim the airdrop by engaging with Orderly:

- **The Road to The \$ORDER - Merits (9.2\%)**: Users who have earned Orderly merits through any of the Orderly builder frontends will qualify for a portion of the airdrop corresponding to the merits they have accrued

- **EVM Early Adopters (3.2\%)**: These are the initial traders who backed Orderly from its inception on EVM until the commencement of the Orderly Merits Campaign.

- **NEAR Early Adopters (0.8\%)**: These early users supported Orderly during its inception on NEAR up to June 10 2024. (Note: NEAR users must link their NEAR address with an EVM address to receive the airdrop.)

- **Social Campaign Participants (0.1\%)**: This group includes community users on Galxe and Zealy who participate in our campaigns and contribute to the advancement of the project and community. There are two main subgroups:
