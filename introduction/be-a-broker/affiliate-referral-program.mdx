## Overview

The referral system is a crucial component of the Orderly ecosystem, designed to incentivize user growth and engagement through a structured rewards program. 

A broker can choose to share part of its broker fees to incentives a distributor/affiliate/referrer for bringing in new traders.
The ecosystem consists of three key participants: 

1.  **The Broker (Dex):** The Dex built on Orderly. Brokers determine the fee structures and maximum rebate limits.
2.  **The Referrer (Affiliate):** A user (e.g., a KOL, influencer, or community leader) who invites others to trade. They can modify the fee split between themselves and the trader, but not the maximum rebate limit.
3.  **The Referee (Trader):** The new user who signs up using a referral code.

## How It Works

### 1. The Binding Process
The Binding is established when a new user (Referee) connects to a Broker and enters a referral code, their account is permanently "bound" to the Referrer. A bound referral code can't be removed or modified after binding.

### 2. The Reward Split
When a Referee executes a trade, the trading fee is split automatically. Orderly Network retains a base protocol fee, and the remaining **Broker Fee** is distributed among the Broker, Referrer, and Referee based on the configured rebate settings.

*   **Referrer Rebate:** Commission earned by the affiliate for inviting the user.
*   **Referee Rebate:** A discount returned to the trader, incentivizing them to use the referral code.
*   **Broker Revenue:** The remaining portion of the fee retained by the platform.

## Example Calculation

The following example demonstrates how fees flow between parties.

**Scenario:**
*   **Orderly Base Fee:** 3 bps Taker fee and 0 bps Maker fee.
*   **Broker Fee Structure:** 6 bps (0.06%) Taker Fee and 3(0.03%) bps Maker Fee.
*   **Broker Net Profit for each trade(regardless of maker/trader):** 3 bps.

**Referral Configuration:**
The Broker generates a code for a KOL with an **80% Max Rebate**, split **50:50** between the Referrer and Referee.

| Party | Share of Net Profit | Calculation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Total Net Profit** | **100%** | **3 bps** |
| **Referee (Trader)** | 40% | Receives 40% of the 3 bps profit as a discount. |
| **Referrer (Affiliate)** | 40% | Receives 40% of the 3 bps profit as commission. |
| **Broker** | 20% | Retains the remaining 20% of the 3 bps profit. |

**In Dollar Terms:**
If a user generates **$10 USDC** in *Net Broker Fees*:
1.  **$4.00** is returned to the Trader (Referee).
2.  **$4.00** is credited to the Affiliate (Referrer).
3.  **$2.00** is retained by the Broker.

## Configuration for Brokers

Brokers manage referral codes and rebate rates via the Orderly Admin Console.


**Admin console:** [https://admin.orderly.network/referral](https://admin.orderly.network/referral)

### Setup Fields

A pop up window will appear for Brokers to create a referral code for an address.

/>

1.  **User Address:** The wallet address of the Affiliate (Referrer) who will own this code.
2.  **Referral Code:** The unique string traders will enter (e.g., `REFFCODE1`).
3.  **Max Rebate:** The total percentage of the Broker's Net Profit allocated for rebates (e.g., 80%).
4.  **Split Slider:** Determines how the rebate is divided:
    *   **Referrer Rebate:** The percentage of the rebate the Affiliate keeps.
    *   **Referee Rebate:** The percentage of the rebate returned to the Trader.

## Distribution

Rewards are calculated automatically by the Orderly protocol.

*   **Frequency:** Rewards are typically distributed **daily**.
*   **Currency:** Payouts are settled in **USDC**.

## Auto referral system

Similar to the affiliate system, the auto-referral system grants traders a referral code once they reach a specific trading volume. This means that instead of manual entry, traders are automatically assigned a code based on their trading activity.
