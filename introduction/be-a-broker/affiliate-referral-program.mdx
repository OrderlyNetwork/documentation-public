## Overview

The referral system is a crucial component of the Orderly ecosystem, designed to incentivize user growth and engagement through a structured rewards program. A broker can choose to share part of its broker fees to incentives a distributor/affiliate/referrer for bringing in new traders.
Orderly powers many different trading platforms, the referral system is integrated directly into the protocol but configured by individual Brokers.

The ecosystem involves three key parties:

1.  **The Broker (Builder):** The Dex building on Orderly. They set the fee structure and the maximum rebate limits.
2.  **The Referrer (Affiliate):** A user (e.g., a KOL or community leader) who invites others to trade. They can modify the fee split between themselves and the trader, but not maximum rebate limit.
3.  **The Referee (Trader):** The new user who signs up using a referral code.

## How It Works

### 1. The Binding Process
The Binding is established when a new user (Referee) connects to a Broker and enters a referral code, their account is permanently "bound" to the Referrer. A bound referral code can't be removed or modified after binding.

### 2. The Reward Split
When the Referee executes a trade, the trading fee is split. Orderly Network takes a base protocol fee, and the remaining "Broker Fee" (Profit) is distributed between the Broker, the Referrer, and the Referee based on the configured rebate settings.

*   **Referrer Rebate:** Income earned by the affiliate for inviting the user.
*   **Referee Rebate:** A discount returned to the trader, incentivizing them to use the code.
*   **Broker Revenue:** The remaining fee kept by the platform.

## Example Calculation

Let's look at a concrete example of how fees flow.

**Scenario:**
*   **Orderly Base Fee:** 3 bps Taker fee and 0 bps Maker fee.
*   **Broker Fee Structure:** 6 bps (0.06%) Taker Fee and 3(0.03%) bps Maker Fee.
*   **Broker Net Profit for each trade(regardless of maker/trader):** 3 bps.

**Referral Configuration:**
The Broker creates a code for a KOL with an **80% Max Rebate**, split **50:50** between the Referrer and Referee.

| Party | Share of Net Profit | Calculation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Total Net Profit** | **100%** | **3 bps** |
| **Referee (Trader)** | 40% | Gets 40% of the 3 bps profit returned as a discount. |
| **Referrer (Affiliate)** | 40% | Gets 40% of the 3 bps profit as commission. |
| **Broker** | 20% | Keeps the remaining 20% of the 3 bps profit. |

**In Dollar Terms:**
If a user generates **$10 USDC** in *Net Broker Fees*:
1.  **$4.00** goes back to the Trader (Referee).
2.  **$4.00** goes to the Affiliate (Referrer).
3.  **$2.00** is kept by the Broker.

## Configuration for Brokers

Brokers manage referral codes and rebate rates via the Orderly Admin Console.
Click ""+ create code" button on the admin portal.

1.  **User Address:** The wallet address of the Affiliate (Referrer) who will own this code.
2.  **Referral Code:** The unique string traders will enter (e.g., `REFFCODE1`).
3.  **Max Rebate:** The total percentage of the Broker's Net Profit to give away (e.g., 80%).
4.  **Split Slider:** How that rebate is divided.
    *   **Referrer Rebate:** % of the rebate the Affiliate keeps.
    *   **Referee Rebate:** % of the rebate returned to the Trader.

## Distribution

Rewards are calculated automatically by the Orderly protocol.

*   **Frequency:** Rewards are typically distributed **daily**.
*   **Currency:** USDC.

## Auto referral system

Similar to the affiliate system, the auto-referral system grants traders a referral code once they reach a specific trading volume. This means that instead of manual entry, traders are automatically assigned a code based on their trading activity.
