title: "Supplemental Terms for Community Strategy Vault"
---

These Supplemental Terms apply to your use of the Community Strategy Vaults, a self-custody smart contract interface provided by Orderly. These Supplemental Terms form part of the Orderly Network Ltd. General Terms of Service (the “Terms”), and are Supplemental Terms as defined in the Terms. In the event of conflict between these Supplemental Terms and the Terms, these Supplemental Terms shall prevail with respect to your use of the Community Strategy Vaults. Capitalised terms not otherwise defined in these Supplemental Terms shall have the meanings given to them in the Terms.

By accessing or using the Community Strategy Vaults, you agree to these Supplemental Terms and the Terms.

These Supplemental Terms may be amended by Orderly Network Ltd. at any time. Updates will be effective upon posting, in the manner set out in the Terms.

## 1. NATURE OF THE SERVICE

**1.1** The Community Strategy Vault is a technology interface. It enables users to get exposure to strategies created by independent third parties (each, a “Strategy Provider”) through a loan of assets to such vault according to a self-custody smart contract.

**1.2** Assets loaned remain under the user’s control and ownership at all times. Orderly does not: (a) pool user assets, (b) custodise assets, (c) direct or manage strategies, (d) act as your agent, fiduciary, investment manager or adviser, or (e) guarantee outcomes.

**1.3** Orderly’s role is limited to infrastructure. Any interaction between a user and a Strategy Provider is independent of Orderly. Users can view available Strategy Providers and strategies directly and must make their own choices.

## 2. HOW THE COMMUNITY STRATEGY VAULT WORKS

**2.1** When you loan assets into the Community Strategy Vault, they are held in a self-custody smart contract. You remain the owner of those assets at all times.

**2.2** You may choose a Strategy Provider from those displayed in the interface. Once selected, the interest rate on your loan is linked to the performance of the strategies run by that Strategy Provider. For the avoidance of doubt, the interest rate may be negative or positive. In the worst case scenario, the interest rate may be negative with the absolute number of that interest amount equal or greater than the loaned amount itself, resulting in a total loss of the loaned amount.

**2.3** Strategies are executed directly by the Strategy Provider through their designated trading account(s) over the loaned assets, which may operate on Orderly’s DEX or other approved venues.

**2.4** Profits or losses from a strategy are reflected in the vault balance. Orderly does not guarantee profits, mitigate losses, or step in if a Strategy Provider underperforms or defaults on obligations. In the worst-case scenario, you may lose your full loaned amount.

**2.5** You may, from time to time, apply for your loan to be partially or fully repaid. Such repayments are processed by smart contract logic. Assets are returned to you within the timeline set out in the smart contract.

## 3. INDEPENDENT STRATEGY PROVIDERS

**3.1** Strategy Providers are solely responsible for the creation, management, and execution of their strategies.

**3.2** Orderly does not monitor, supervise, vet, endorse, or guarantee any Strategy Provider or their performance.

**3.3** Any fees, including performance fees, are determined and managed by the relevant Strategy Provider.

## 4. NO INVESTMENT PRODUCTS OR ADVICE

**4.1** The Community Strategy Vault is a technology service only. It provides infrastructure for users to apply strategies developed by independent third parties (“Strategy Providers”) to assets in the relevant vault. It is not, and should not be construed as, a deposit, investment contract, security, collective investment scheme, pooled fund, portfolio management service, or any other regulated financial product. Orderly makes no representations and disclaims all liability on whether Strategy Providers are performing a licensed activity and/or breaching any applicable laws and regulations. Strategy Providers are responsible for obtaining independent advice on their legal and regulatory obligations when performing this role and Orderly does not monitor or control them.

**4.2** Orderly Network Ltd. does not pool assets, take custody, intermediate transactions between users and Strategy Providers, or exercise discretion over strategies. Orderly does not act as your agent, broker, fiduciary, investment manager, or adviser.

**4.3** Nothing in connection with the Community Strategy Vault constitutes financial, investment, tax, accounting, or legal advice. Any information made available (including strategy performance data, analytics, or reporting tools) is provided solely for informational purposes and should not be relied upon as advice of any kind.

**4.4** You are solely responsible for: (a) assessing whether use of the Community Strategy Vault or any strategy is suitable for you in light of your financial objectives, experience, and risk tolerance; (b) ensuring that your participation is lawful in your jurisdiction; and (c) complying with all applicable laws, regulations, and tax obligations.

## 5. RISKS

**5.1** Use of the Community Strategy Vault involves substantial risks of which Orderly is not liable for, including but not limited to:

- market volatility and adverse price movements,
- failure, underperformance, or mismanagement of trading strategies,
- misconduct, negligence, or default by Strategy Providers,

- changes in laws, regulations, enforcement priorities, or government action that may restrict or prohibit the Community Strategy Vault or particular strategies,
- adverse or uncertain tax treatment and reporting obligations,
- force majeure events beyond Orderly’s control, including cyberattacks, natural disasters, or geopolitical events.

**5.2** You acknowledge and accept that you may lose part or all of your assets, and that all risk is borne solely by you. Orderly will not reimburse, insure, or otherwise cover any losses.

**5.3** Orderly makes no warranty or representation that the Community Strategy Vault or any strategy will be available, uninterrupted, secure, or error-free. Orderly expressly disclaims all liability for any outcomes of strategies.

## 6. USER RESPONSIBILITIES
