## TradingView License

Our platform uses TradingView for price charts, which requires a commercial license. You can obtain one at:
[TradingView Advanced Charts](https://www.tradingview.com/advanced-charts/)

When applying for the license, we can help with the following application details:

- **Website URL**: Use your purchased domain
- **Github Profile**: We will provide this information
- **Company Profile**: "Crypto Exchange"
- **Own Data Feed**: Yes
- **Reason for Request**: Mention that this is for a perpetual futures decentralized exchange

Please reach out to us if you need any assistance with the application process.

## Deployment

We will handle the deployment process for you through Vercel. Our team will:

1. Set up a test deployment for your review
2. Make any necessary adjustments based on your feedback
3. Deploy to production once everything is approved

This ensures a smooth transition from development to production while maintaining the highest quality standards.
