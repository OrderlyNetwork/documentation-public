Any realized and unrealized PnL accrued from open or closed positions needs to be “Settled” into the USDC balance of the account. PnL settlement can happen anytime for any account if other users trigger a settlement. Any user can also trigger PnL settlement of their own account by following these steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get a Settle PnL nonce">
    Get a nonce from [Get settle PnL nonce](/build-on-evm/evm-api/restful-api/private/get-settle-pnl-nonce).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Obtain signature from EIP-712">
    Sign an EIP-712 message in the following format:
```json
{
    "brokerId": "woofi_dex",
    "chainId": 80001,
    "settleNonce": 1,
    "timestamp": 1685973017064
}
```

where:

| **Name**    | **Type**  | **Required** | **Description**                                              |
| ----------- | --------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| brokerId    | string    | Y            | Broker ID, the valid list can be found \[here\]              |
| chainId     | int       | Y            | Chain ID of the connected chain where the message was signed |
| settleNonce | int       | Y            | Valid withdrawal nonce from [Get settle PnL nonce](/build-on-evm/evm-api/restful-api/private/get-settle-pnl-nonce)           |
| timestamp   | timestamp | Y            | current timestamp in UNIX milliseconds                       |

  </Step>
  <Step title="Request PnL settlement">
    Request a PnL settlement through [Request Pnl settlement API](/build-on-evm/evm-api/restful-api/private/request-pnl-settlement).
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Example

The example code is very similar to the [Orderly key registration](/build-on-evm/user-flows/wallet-authentication#full-example), except it uses the EIP-712 [on-chain domain](/build-on-evm/user-flows/wallet-authentication#on-chain-domain) and the signed message is different.
