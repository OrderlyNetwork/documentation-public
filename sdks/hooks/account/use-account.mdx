- [Tech docs](/sdks/tech-doc/modules/orderly_network_hooks#useaccount)

## Create account

```typescript
const { createAccount } = useAccount();

const res = await createAccount();
```

## Orderly Key

Creates an `OrderlyKey`. The validity of the `OrderlyKey` (in days) can be set.

```typescript
const { createOrderlyKey } = useAccount();

const res = await createOrderlyKey(30);
```

After the `OrderlyKey` is successfully created, it will be stored in the `KeyStore`, and will be used for API signatures later on.

## KeyStore

The [`KeyStore` instance](/sdks/tech-doc/interfaces/orderly_network_core.OrderlyKeyStore) is responsible for storing the Orderly private key, which is used for trading.
By default the key will be stored in local Storage, but a custom `KeyStore` implementation can be given to `OrderlyConfigProvider` like explained [here](/sdks/hooks/setup).

```ts
const { account } = useAccount();
account.keyStore.getOrderlyKey();
account.keyStore.cleanAllKey(address);
// ...
```

## Account status

The `Account` object has the following statuses:

```typescript
export enum AccountStatusEnum {
  NotConnected = 0,
  Connected = 1,
  NotSignedIn = 2,
  SignedIn = 3,
  DisabledTrading = 4,
  EnableTrading = 5
}
```

The above statuses are represented as follows:

- `NotConnected`/ `Connected` - Wallet connection status, not related to Orderly. `NotConnected` means no wallet connected, `Connected` means the wallet app is connected and we know the user's wallet address.
- `NotSignedIn` / `SignedIn` - The result from calling [`Get Account Information`](/build-on-omnichain/evm-api/restful-api/private/get-account-information) or [`Register Account`](/build-on-omnichain/evm-api/restful-api/public/register-account). `NotSignedIn` means there's no registered account associated with the wallet address and `brokerId` pair. `SignedIn` means that an account has been previously registered with the wallet address and `brokerId` pair.
- `DisabledTrading` / `EnableTrading` - The result from calling [`Get Orderly Key`](/build-on-omnichain/evm-api/restful-api/public/get-orderly-key) or [`Add Orderly Key`](/build-on-omnichain/evm-api/restful-api/public/add-orderly-key). `DisabledTrading` means no active Orderly Key is found in the `KeyStore`. `EnableTrading` means an active Orderly Key is found in the `KeyStore` and can be used to authenticate for any private API requests.

### Get account status

There are two ways to get the account status. You can get it either directly from `useAccount`'s value, or through subscribing to the account status change event:

- Retrieve from the `state` value in `useAccount`:

```typescript
const { state } = useAccount();
```

`state` also contains the following account info, as shown below:

```typescript
interface AccountState {
  status: AccountStatusEnum;
  checking: boolean;
  accountId?: string;
  userId?: string;
  address?: string;
}
```

- Subscribe to the `change:status` event in the `Account` instance. (`account` is a singleton of the `Account` instance)ã€‚

```typescript
const { account } = useAccount();

const statusChangeHandler = (nextState: AccountState) => {
  // do something
};

useEffect(() => {
  account.on("change:status", statusChangeHandler);

  return () => {
    account.off("change:status", statusChangeHandler);
  };
}, []);
```

### Update account status

`@orderly.network/hooks` currently does not provide the functionality for connecting wallets, **builders have to handle wallet connection logic themselves**, [refer here](#how-to-integrate-wallet).

Once the user has successfully connected a wallet, use the `setAddress` method to pass the `address` to the `Account` instance. 3 additional parameters need to be passed when calling `setAddress`:

- `provider` - provider according to the `EIP1193Provider` standard
- `chain` - information regarding the connected chain, including the `id`
- `wallet` - wallet information, including the name of the wallet app

The `setAddress` method in `Account` will check the `accound_id` and the existence of any valid `OrderlyKey` from the provided `address` and update the `state`. If the `state` is `AccountStatusEnum.EnableTrading`, then the full login process in complete and the user can then access all functionalities provided by Orderly.

```typescript
const { account, state } = useAccount();

//... logic for connecting wallets ...

/**
 * setAddress will return Promise<AccountStatusEnum>, and state will be updated
 */
const nextState = await account.setAddress("<address>", {
  provider: provider, // EIP1193Provider, usually window.ethereum
  chain: {
    id: "0x1" // chain id, e.g. 0x1 for Ethereum Mainnet, it's a hex string
  },
  wallet: {
    name: "" // Wallet app name, e.g. MetaMask
  }
});
```

### Switch Chain

```tsx
  const account = useAccountInstance();

  const handleChainSelect = (id: string) => {
    // Remember to also switch chain in your wallet provider (e.g., wagmi, web3-onboard)
    account.switchChainId(id);
  }

return (
  {supportedChains
    .filter(({ network }) => network === "mainnet")
    .map(({ id, icon, label, chainId }) => (
      <button key={id} onClick={handleChainSelect(id)}>
        {label}
      </button>
    ))
  }
);
```
