Follow the steps below to integrate the Orderly SDK into your project:

## Add Basic Dependencies

### Install the Base Component Libraries

```
npm install @orderly.network/ui @orderly.network/react-app
```

### Add Styles to Your Project

Reference the style file by adding the following code to your project:

```ts
import "@orderly.network/ui/dist/styles.css";
```

### Add a Global Configuration Provider

Wrap your application with the `OrderlyAppProvider` component to set global configurations:

```tsx
import React, { FC, ReactNode } from "react";
import { OrderlyAppProvider } from "@orderly.network/react-app";

const App: FC<{ children: ReactNode }> = (props) => {
  return (
    <OrderlyAppProvider brokerId="orderly" brokerName="Orderly" networkId="testnet" appIcons={""}>
      {props.children}
    </OrderlyAppProvider>
  );
};
```

### Add Wallet Connection

Orderly SDK provides a built-in wallet connection component supporting both EVM and Solana. Here’s how to integrate it:

#### Install Wallet Connector Dependencies

```
npm install @orderly.network/wallet-connector
```

#### Add the WalletConnectorProvider Component

Wrap your application with the `WalletConnectorProvider` for wallet connection functionality:

```tsx
import { WalletConnectorProvider } from "@orderly.network/wallet-connector";
import { WalletAdapterNetwork } from "@solana/wallet-adapter-base";

const App: FC<{ children: ReactNode }> = (props) => {
  return (
    <WalletConnectorProvider solanaInitial={{network: WalletAdapterNetwork.Mainnet }}>
      <OrderlyAppProvider brokerId="orderly" brokerName="Orderly" networkId="testnet" appIcons={""}>
        {props.children}
      </OrderlyAppProvider>
    </WalletConnectorProvider>
  );
};
```

Alternatively, you can integrate third-party wallet libraries by implementing the `WalletConnectorContextState`
interface from `@orderly.network/hooks`.

## Add Pages

### Page Layout

If you want to use the SDK’s built-in top navigation, side navigation, and other layout features, install the layout library:

```
npm install @orderly.network/ui-scaffold
```

### Add the Scaffold component to your application:

```tsx
import Scaffold from "@orderly.network/ui-scaffold";

<Scaffold
  mainNavProps={
    {
      // Please refer to the example code and configure as needed.
    }
  }
  footerProps={{}}
  routerAdapter={{
    onRouteChange, //Handle user click events on the navigation menu.
    currentPath: "/"
  }}
>
  {/* page component */}
  {children}
</Scaffold>;
```

For certain page components, the SDK also provides ready-made layout components. For example, you can directly import the layout for `@orderly.network/portfolio`.

### Page Components

The SDK includes the following page components:

Trading - `@orderly.network/trading`

Portfolio - `@orderly.network/portfolio`

Referral - `@orderly.network/referral`

Markets - `@orderly.network/markets`

Trading Rewards - `@orderly.network/trading-rewards`

Affiliate - `@orderly.network/affiliate`

You can integrate these with your preferred React routing framework. Here are examples for popular frameworks:

- [Next.js](https://github.com/OrderlyNetwork/orderly-js-sdk-nextjs-template)

- [CRA](https://github.com/OrderlyNetwork/orderly-js-sdk-cra-template)
